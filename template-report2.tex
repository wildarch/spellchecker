\section{Introduction}

In this project we explore the creation of a spell checker, used for correcting english sentences with at most 2 errors per sentence (and no consecutive incorrect words). We do this using an approach of natural language processing we were taught in this course: reasoning with probabilities about the words and sentences that have to be corrected. In this report we will describe how we approached the problem, how we tried to solve it, and why we solved it the way we did.


\section{Overall approach }

\emph{Give a full discussion of how you have followed the general
set-up as given by the course material and how you have implemented
your spell checker.}

\section{Phrase generation and evaluation}

\emph{Give a full discussion of how you have implemented phrase generation
and have the best candidate sentence is selected. In particular, describe
what rule the confusion matrices and bigrams play a role in attaching
a value/probability to a candidate sentence. Also describe what type
of smoothing you use and how you have implemented it.}

\section{Results and evaluation}

\emph{Provide an overall assessment of your programs. What type of
errors is it good at to catch and repair, which type or errors are
missed or wrongly repaired. Explain what could be done, in principle,
to improve your program. Discuss how you have calibrated the relevant
parameters.}

\section{Advanced enhancements}

\emph{Several extensions and enhancements of the basic set-up of the
spell checker are possible. Describe explicitly what you have incorporated
from other sources than the course material to improve the performance
of your program and in what way the performance did improve indeed. }

\section{Conclusions and contributions}

\emph{A short logical summing up of the main reported results and
a statement on the contributions of each of the authors.}
